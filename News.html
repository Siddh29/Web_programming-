        <h1>What’s the future of fintech and banking in an agentic AI era?</h1>
        <h3>Early use cases were task-specific like reducing payment failures, improving fraud detection, accelerating
            customer
            service. <br>
            “The future is agentic AI,” Mr. Jagannath said. “Not one agent, but a multitude of agents with
            human-like
            reasoning, working together to complete processes end-to-end”
        </h3>

        “For agents to be truly powerful, the underlying systems must be modern,” said Kiran Jagannath, Head - FSI and
        Conglomerates at AWS India and South Asia | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement
        <br>
        <h3>India’s banks, insurers, and fintech firms are prototyping, testing and deploying a set of AI-infused
            measures in their customer facing functions.<br> Some of these firms are undergoing a new shift: from
            software buyers to software builders.
        </h3>
        Few people have had a front-row seat to this transformation the way Kiran Jagannath, Head of Financial Services
        and Conglomerates at AWS India, has. <br>
        In a wide-ranging conversation, on the sidelines of AWS re:Invent 2025, he
        explained how cloud, generative AI, agentic orchestration, data modernization,<br> and culture are converging
        into
        what he calls “a completely new operating model for financial services.”
        <br>
        1. Agentic AI is shifting from trend to transformation
        <br>
        Financial institutions worldwide are piloting agentic AI at scale — AI agents are no longer just prototypes but
        central to operations like customer service, fraud detection and risk management.
        <br>
        Experts predict enterprise-scale adoption in 2026 rather than isolated improvements — AI will be deeply embedded
        in payments, customer engagement, and risk processes.<br>
        <br>
        2. Banks are rearchitecting technology stacks for agents
        <br>
        The 2026 era of Banking 4.0 will involve production-level AI agents integrated into core systems rather than
        peripheral tools.
        <br>
        However, only a small percentage of financial services firms are currently using AI agents at full scale,
        according to new research — indicating early but rising adoption.<br>
        <br>
        3. AI at industry events & strategic initiatives
        <br>
        Major players like Wells Fargo, Starling Bank, Anthropic are highlighting agentic AI in platforms such as
        Money20/20 USA — showing interest in fraud detection, next-generation customer experiences, and enterprise
        automation.<br>

        <h2>Additional Context from Industry Reports</h2>
        🔹 Visa sees agentic AI as next leap in payments
        Agentic AI is projected to generate a $175 billion global market by 2030, with the potential to autonomously
        optimize payments, loyalty, and travel booking experiences — while emphasizing trust, privacy and security.
        <br>
        🔹 Banks & insurers deploying AI agents now
        Capgemini research shows AI agents being actively deployed across fraud detection, loan processing, onboarding,
        underwriting and claims — reshaping what financial services do for customers.
        <br>
        🔹 Wells Fargo’s agentic strategy
        Wells Fargo is redesigning systems around agentic AI, including platforms that let agents support employees and
        customers across workflows, not just answer questions.
        <br>
        🔹 Shift from pilots to economic value
        Analysts predict that agentic AI could deliver hundreds of billions in economic value by 2028, but firms must
        overcome legacy system constraints to realize this potential.
